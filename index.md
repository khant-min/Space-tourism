Notes!

1. Responsiveness is so bad in this project
2. CSS codes are too much complex, combine and repeat
3. In my situation, electricity is lack every hour
4. I don't have vision of designs so fonts might be a little bit ugly🙁
5. This project takes me for three or four weeks and I'm so tired 😫
6. Sorry for grammar if I have any mistakes. English is not my first language
7. Thanks you guys!!!
